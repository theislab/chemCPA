# Seq2Seq

This is a baseline model, a simple LSTM-based Seq2Seq model without any bells-or-whistles (eg no teacher-forcing).
Code largely taken from [DeepChem examples](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/examples/tutorials/Learning_Unsupervised_Embeddings_for_Molecules.ipynb).

This model isn't great and shouldn't be used for any real production runs.

I upload my notebooks for here now, I will integrate them better into the chemCPA structure later

The order to run the notebooks is 
- Load_Norman
- Combine_anndatas
- Adjust_embeddings_to_anndata
- First_Data_Loader 

I uploaded all the anndatas to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TToehfUbS6WPGPv8s3FhBDBBHRPHTVwe?usp=sharing
